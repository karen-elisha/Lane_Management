# Lane_Management
This project uses Mediapipe for real-time hand gesture detection and OpenCV for video capture and image processing. Flash triggers photo capture when combined with gestures, and Tesseract OCR extracts digits from images. It also preprocesses images, making it ideal for gesture-based text recognition systems.
